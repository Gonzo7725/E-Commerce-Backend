# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

This week we were challenged to create an E-commerce-backend such as Shopify or WooCommerce. The goal is to understand the architecture of these platforms. The E-Commerce Backend is a REST API for an internet retail website. The API is built on to an Express.js server that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This E-commerce-backend has API routes that point to each of the CRUD operations for each data group. With these routes we can create categories, products, and tags, view them, update them and also delete them from the database.

## Installation 

-npm install dependencies(mysql2, express, sequelize)
-run the schema database
-npm run seed
-npm start will run the application


## Usage

With this application we can get data for categories, products, and tags, as well as create, update, and delete the data in those routes.
